# wordle-solver

A Hackey CLI solver for wordle 

Run as follows: 

1. `clone git repo`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn run start`

It will give you a suggested guess, and prompt you to tell it what you guessed e.g. irate and the score e.g. 12000 (0=Black, 1=Yellow, 2=Green)

It then narrows the word list and gives you the next guess
